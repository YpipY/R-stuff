# Language development in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)

Background: Autism Spectrum Disorder is often related to language impairment. However, this phenomenon has not been empirically traced in detail:
i) relying on actual naturalistic language production, 
ii) over extended periods of time.

We therefore videotaped circa 30 kids with ASD and circa 30 comparison kids (matched by linguistic performance at visit 1) for ca. 30 minutes of naturalistic interactions with a parent. We repeated the data collection 6 times per kid, with 4 months between each visit. We transcribed the data and counted: 
i) the amount of words that each kid uses in each video. Same for the parent.
ii) the amount of unique words that each kid uses in each video. Same for the parent.
iii) the amount of morphemes per utterance (Mean Length of Utterance) displayed by each child in each video. Same for the parent. 

This data is in the file you prepared in the previous class. 

NB. A few children have been excluded from your datasets. We will be using them next week to evaluate how good your models are in assessing the linguistic development in new participants.

We then want to test the language trajectory of child and parent over time.

This RMarkdown file is structured in the following way:

1. The exercises: read them carefully. Under each exercise you will have to write your answers, once you have written and run the code. This is the part that you have to directly send to the teachers.
2. An (optional) guided template full of hints for writing the code to solve the exercises. Fill in the code and the paragraphs as required. Then report your results under the exercise part.
3. In exercise 4 you will be asked to create the best possible model of language development in TD and ASD children, picking and choosing whatever additional variables you want from the dataset. Next time, the models produced by the different groups will compete against each other to see who can produce the best model, so choose carefully!

You will have to have a github repository for the code and send the answers to Malte and Riccardo without code (but a link to your github/gitlab repository). This way we can check your code, but you are also forced to figure out how to report your analyses :-)

Remember to submit only your findings, and not just the code. To do this you can either
- Write your answers in a separate document
- Write your answers in the template, but tell rstudio not to print the code chunks when you knit it with the chunk option include=FALSE

```{r, include=FALSE}
# with include=FALSE, the code will still run
x = 1
# but it will not print anything
print(x)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# if you want to hide the code but show the output (a plot for instance)
# you can use echo = FALSE
print(x+10)
```

To re-iterate one more time: Hand in a document with your findings but without code (html or pdf or word) and a link to your github/gitlab with your Rmd file.

N.B. The following lines are a summary of the questions to be answered, the step-by-step instructions and tips are in the template.

## Exercise 1) Preliminary Data Exploration

Describe the participant samples in the dataset (e.g. by diagnosis, age, etc.). Do you think the two groups are well balanced? If not, what do you think was the reason?

### Exercise 2) Children learning language: the effects of time and ASD
Describe linguistic development in TD and ASD children in terms of Mean Length of Utterance (MLU)?

### Exercise 3) Child directed speech as a moving target
Describe how parental use of language changes over time in terms of MLU. What do you think is going on?

### Exercise 4) Looking into "individual differences" (demographic, clinical or cognitive profiles)
The dataset contains some additional variables characterizing the kidsâ€™ cognitive and clinical profile: ADOS (autism severity), MSEL EL (Expressive Language, that is, verbal IQ, or linguistic skills at first visit as assessed by a psychologist using Mullen Scales of Early Learning), MSEL VR (Visual Reception, used as a proxy for non verbal IQ at first visit), Age, Gender, Ethnicity. Would it make sense to add any of them to your model of linguistic trajectories? Create the best possible model (the one that best explain the data, with MLU as outcome). Next time your model will be tested on new participants, and we will proclaim a winner. Describe your strategy to select the best models (how did you choose the variables to include?) and send the code to Riccardo and Celine.

### [OPTIONAL] Exercise 5) Comment on how the three linguistic variables measure linguistic performance (the so-called "construct validity" of the measures). Do they express the same variance?
